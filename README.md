# CatSnap
CatSnap is a fun little web app that shows random cat images and facts using two public APIs — TheCatAPI and Cat Fact Ninja.

###  Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Axios (for fetching facts)

### Features
- Click the button to fetch a new cat image and fact
- Responsive UI with playful design

### Note
I do not own the APIs used in this project. They’re provided by:
- [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) – for cat images
- [Cat Fact Ninja](https://catfact.ninja/) – for facts

Built by [Kanhai](https://github.com/kksah2063) to learn API integration and frontend styling.
